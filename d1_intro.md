Database is a collection of interconnected tables

We use sql to communicate with databases

Tables, Rows and Columns

In databases like spreadsheets we have rows and columns.
Columns in each table exist as headers and their data types are defined
Rows are dynamic than columns

Today there are several database products and vendors, we will stick to standard SQL

ðŸ’¡ Querying the database
For querying an existing table we use the below syntax

SELECT column_name
FROM table_name
SELECT keyword selects the necessary column names

FROM keywords defines which table we are using for querying

In the realm of databases, it's essential to treat them like machines that require precise details to yield the desired output. Therefore, we must provide accurate column names and ensure the table includes the necessary columns; otherwise, errors may occur.
